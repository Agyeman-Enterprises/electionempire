## 📜 LIVING HISTORY

```

- Can repeal it (political cost)
- Creates policy legacy

**Scandal Decisions:**

- **Policy Legacies** - Past policies shape current options
- **Presidential Legacies** - Past presidents influence current discourse

## 🔍 EXPLOITABLE GHOSTS

### Study Former Players' Patterns

**Ghost Study System:**
1. Identify a ghost opponent
2. **Start studying** their behavior profile
3. **Invest time/resources** to learn more
4. **Discover weaknesses** they had
5. **Generate exploitation strategies**
6. **Use their own tactics against them**

### Knowledge Levels

- **0-30%**: Basic info (known weaknesses, favorite tactics)
- **30-50%**: Discover new weaknesses
- **50-70%**: Discover all tactics
- **70-100%**: Generate exploitation strategies

### Exploitation Strategies

Based on discovered weaknesses:
- **Pressure Tactics** - If they panic under stress
- **Bold Moves** - If they're risk-averse
- **Alliance Manipulation** - If they're disloyal
- **Media Attacks** - If they're media-sensitive
- **Scandal Triggers** - If they have exploitable patterns

### Example Exploitation

```
You study "CorruptCarl's Ghost"
    → Discover: Panics when approval drops below 40%
    → Discover: Always denies scandals (never apologizes)
    → Discover: Weakness: Overconfidence in dirty tricks
    
Exploitation Strategy:
    → Drop their approval below 40% (they panic)
    → Trigger a scandal (they'll deny it)
    → Use their own dirty tricks against them
    → They'll overreact and make mistakes
```

### Historical Research

Study a ghost's **historical record**:
- What scandals did they survive?
- What policies did they enact?
- How did they respond to crises?
- What was their legacy?

**Use this knowledge** to predict their behavior!
